### User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### Acceptance Criteria

Given the on-the-job codebase.
Then the website must meet accessibility standards:

* Can semantic HTML elements be found throughout the source code?
* Do those HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning?
* Do image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes?
* Do heading attributes fall in sequential order?
* Do title elements contain a concise, descriptive title?
* Has the web application been deployed?
